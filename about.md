Some information about you!

### More Information

I am 12 years old. My guardians are Chrystie and Marvin. I have a sibling named Tyler. We have a beautiful family. My favorite color....would probably be Maroon. I am a full-on redneck. I am definetly a country hottie. (Just Kidding) ANYWAYS......I have lots of self esteem issues and I would love to learn from the best about how to be more confident about myself. I have a very little amount of friends. But its better to have a few good friends than several fake ones.
