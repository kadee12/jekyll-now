title: New Day, New Start
---
Do you ever feel as if your the only one who understands yourself? Well if you have you know what it feels like to be empty inside. I feel as if at one point after I bottle everything up, I will suddenly explode on everybody. Today I felt alone. Like nobody wanted me here. ANYWAYS...since I have been so deep in thought...why don't I help others feel better?
Well today this is when j start over, with a new beginning, and a gorgeous ending. 
I grew up with anxiety as in I can't do anything without screaming so loud in my head that MY own head pops off. I hate crowds. You know what...I don't hate I dislike crowds. I dislike people who decide to bully me or my friends! But I love my family and friends. I love my artistic abilities. I love dancing. I love singing. And I sure do love Kyla Marie Price. Now and then you will get this feeling, not exactly jealousy, but disgust, sorrow,and loneliness. Thank your for reading! Goodnight y'all!!
