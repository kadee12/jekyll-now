title: Bullying

It's all one big ball of stress when it comes to bullying. Everything you think and say will leave you in regret. It can be either way. Your the bully, or someone else is. You can be the target, or you can target someone.  Any way it put it still sucks. People will come and go. I stay. And I move on. I get through it. You on the other hand it takes time. It took me time. But again, I got through it. I learned how to fight and think through it. I learned the best of myself. I learned to love and control myself and others. Just like god did. And trust me, it's hard. But trust in those who love and help you. Have faith in yourself and others. Because we the people love you. And we always will. Deep inside all the people in the world know and think how to help thereselves and others. Because I love you. And I love myself. Not in a selfish way. But in a loving way. Because I believe in society and faith. Just like you should. I know not everyone and everything will come up to you with a warming welcome. Some will love, and some will dislike. Just like I once did. Thank you for reading. Goodnight y'all!
