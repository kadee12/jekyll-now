title: Totally Inspired.

You know how on Tumblr, Twitter, facebook,(definitely Pinterest), you find something...at some point that inspires you to do something creative and incredible? Well today was my day to inspire others. So let me tell you right now. It's okay to not want to express your feelings but the part that brings us all down, is not talking about what or who is bothering us. We have ups, and we have downs. But, in the end we inspire others to learn from our mistakes and inspire even more people. So yes life can bring you down. But just keep talking. It will progress and get better from there. I know this from experience. I have been through every little piece of depression. The cutting, the thoughts, the shut-outs. It doesn't help nor does it make anything better. So keep living your life with your chin up and yours hands at your hips with FULL sass. And let me tell you, it's not easy being me. It's not easy being depressed, bullied, anxious, or lonely. I bring myself down every second of the day. But that one friend who has always stuck by me is Kyla. She was there with me through hell and back. And yes, I love her. No homo here. Just loving my life and what has come of it. Thanks for listening!! Goodnight y'all!
